## Timeline
> Note: Things is not strictly chronological. The main purpose is to chronicle my coding journey. 

- Old times (childhood): Learned Scratch and engaged in scientific crafting when I was a child.Opening the door to information technology and creation.
- 2018-2019: Self-studied information competitions, gained a foundation in **algorithms** and programming languages(**c/c++**).
- February 2022: Started learning software engineering, studied **Python**, and created [a small game](https://github.com/Edge-coordinates/Outer_space), [a Django library website](https://github.com/ICS-Community/ICS-Library/tree/Django_old), and [a novel data crawling project](https://github.com/ICS-Community/ICS-Library/tree/Django_old/Bookspider) using Python.
> I have also written some other small projects with python, and [some plugins]() developed/modified for PagerMaid-Pyro have been well-received.  
> **Reading List:** 
- June 2022: Started learning JS and various miscellaneous topics(such as database). Developed some small projects and served as one of the the main member of the iFlytek tablet cracking workgroup.  
> During this period, I focused on practicing and created [Lite Reader](https://github.com/Edge-coordinates/Electonrn_learning/tree/master/Lite_reader-V0.0.1) (the first generation of an unprecedented super-lightweight computer novel reader) and [Study_lab](https://github.com/Edge-coordinates/Electonrn_learning/tree/master/Study_Lab_ts_01) (a project mainly created for competitions, it includes the second version of the reader).   
> I attempted to deploy some open-source projects to enhance my server usage skills and submit a few issues.  
> **Reading List:** 
- Miscellaneous Notes: Scripting is truly a very interesting activity! [Light_tools](https://github.com/Edge-coordinates/Light_tools)(some utility scripts written in Python) [JS Script]()
- 

**The story continues.**
